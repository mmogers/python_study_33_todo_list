```python
myPartyList = []

def printList():
  print() 
  for item in myPartyList:
    print(item)
  print() 

while True:
  menu = input("add or remove?: ")
  if menu == "add":
    item = input("Who should I add to the party list?: ")
    myPartyList.append(item)
  elif menu == "remove":
    item = input("Who should I remove from the party list?: ")
    if item in myPartyList:
      myPartyList.remove(item)
    else:
      print(f"{item} was not in the list")
  printList()

```

- You have to start with the name of your blank list.
- Make sure you use `append` and `remove` (not `add`).
- Don't forget your f-string.
- There may be a few `=` and `"` missing too.
